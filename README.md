# homekit-nest
HomeKit Support for [Nest](http://nest.com) using [HomeControl](https://github.com/brutella/hc) and ~~[lifx](https://github.com/wolfeidau/lifx)~~ [Nest go library]https://github.com/jsgoecke/nest).

Nest thermostats are automatically discovered and published as HomeKit accessories on your local network.
After pairing the thermostats with HomeKit using any iOS HomeKit app (e.g. [Home](http://selfcoded.com/home/)), you can:

- use Siri to control your thermostats voice command â€“ *Hey Siri set temprature to 70 degrees*
- remotely access your lights using HomeKit Remote Access (HomeKit uses strong end-to-end encryption)
